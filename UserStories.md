User Stories we've decided to move on for this project [Albert and Clayton add things in this section]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------





User Stories gathered from user conversations (related to animal welfare):
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
- As an advocate concerned with animal welfare, I want to be able to do key word searches on report narratives so I can save staff hours

- As an advocate concerned with animal welfare, I want to be able to look at facility-by-facility data on violations and inspections so I can guide local action.




User Stories gather from user conversations (related to other USDA data):
------------------------------------------------------------------------
- As a lobbyist concerned with food safety on a national level, I want to be able to see plant-by-plant data on pathogens and chemical contaminants so that I can take local action on individual facilities' bad actors.
--Poultry safety is an example: when it got hot in the midwest, pathogen rates skyrocketed when chickens were under distress. Seeing which facilities this was happening in would have been helpful.

- As a lobbyist concerned with food safety, I want to be able to see narrower product categories in the FATUS audit reports (like the breakdowns that ERS maintains, e.g. ground beef versus just "beef"), so I can make informed arguments for why we are and aren't importing from certain countries.

- As a food safety consumer advocate, I want to be able to see the number of noncompliance reports by facility and company on the USDA website so I can take action quickly on public health issues of immediate concern.
--This is a high priority for advocates: takes Tony a year to get some of the info he FOIAs, which is not helpful for health concerns happening right now.
--FCIS FOIA office is good but probably understaffed for the volume of requests they get. Probably 20 FOIA requests a month - this would go down if they were more transparent.

- [In our perfect world] As a USDA administrator, I want to be able to provide transparent facility by facility information on pathogens up front so I can keep my FOIA backlog down and spend less money and time resolving it.
--It sounds like USDA wanted to do this - but industry during Bush administration fought it.
