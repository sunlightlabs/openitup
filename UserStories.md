User Stories we've decided to move on for this project [Albert and Clayton add things in this section]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------





User Stories gathered from user conversations (related to animal welfare):
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
- As an advocate concerned with animal welfare, I want to be able to do key word searches on report narratives so I can save staff hours

- As an advocate concerned with animal welfare, I want to be able to look at facility-by-facility data on violations and inspections so I can guide local action.

- As a research assistant, I want to export annual data so that I can track inspections of every research facility.

- As the manager of Captive Wildlife Protection, I want to easily search and export data daily for exhibitors, violations, and inventories.

- As a pet store manager, I want to be able to easily access latest USDA inspection reports to see violations from dealers.

- As a research assistant, I want to be able to bulk export animal research issues data for tracking the issues.

- As a citizen looking to buy a new animal, I want to be able to view the violations database where clear distinctions are made between violations.

- As a journalist looking into how APHIS has followed up on the OIG audit, I want to be able to search by violation type (Direct, Significant, Veterinary Care, etc.) to see the total violations, as well as the variety between each violation type, as its been speculated that USDA APHIS is not earkmarking violations correctly to keep numbers down/under the radar.

- As a journalist looking into APHIS frequent violators, I want to be able to access exported data that includes the facilities physical address, in order to track down multiple facilities owned by same people, to track down total number of animals per state/locality, and to attach inspection report id numbers to an actual physical location.




User Stories gather from user conversations (related to other USDA data):
------------------------------------------------------------------------
- As a lobbyist concerned with food safety on a national level, I want to be able to see plant-by-plant data on pathogens and chemical contaminants so that I can take local action on individual facilities' bad actors.
--Poultry safety is an example: when it got hot in the midwest, pathogen rates skyrocketed when chickens were under distress. Seeing which facilities this was happening in would have been helpful.

- As a lobbyist concerned with food safety, I want to be able to see narrower product categories in the FATUS audit reports (like the breakdowns that ERS maintains, e.g. ground beef versus just "beef"), so I can make informed arguments for why we are and aren't importing from certain countries.

- As a food safety consumer advocate, I want to be able to see the number of noncompliance reports by facility and company on the USDA website so I can take action quickly on public health issues of immediate concern.
--This is a high priority for advocates: takes Tony a year to get some of the info he FOIAs, which is not helpful for health concerns happening right now.
--FCIS FOIA office is good but probably understaffed for the volume of requests they get. Probably 20 FOIA requests a month - this would go down if they were more transparent.

- [In our perfect world] As a USDA administrator, I want to be able to provide transparent facility by facility information on pathogens up front so I can keep my FOIA backlog down and spend less money and time resolving it.
--It sounds like USDA wanted to do this - but industry during Bush administration fought it.

- As a , I would like to export FSIS data posted by plant so I can track individual plant facilities.

- As a , I would like to get FSIS data that is non-aggregated for better clarity to which plants are over/under performing routine inspection tests.

- As a , I would likt to access FSIS foreign country data in a tabular/non-descriptive format so that it is easily digestible and not time consuming, as well as tedious (not sure which is data, not sure which is important data, etc.).

- As a consumer group, I would like to access non-compliance reports online (preferably as they are released) so we can track companies that are involved in the process.

- As a , I would like to access FSIS data with detailed categories instead of the broad approach they are taking currently, so that I can see/track real statistics, regarding real things, instead of broad statistics, vaguely referring to large real things.

- As a FSIS employee, I would like to input FSIS data in a better method than what is currently in place, so that taking the time to label something properly is not difficult/I don't have to think.
